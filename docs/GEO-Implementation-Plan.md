# üìù GEO Implementation Plan

## 1. Technical (Dev/SEO) Implementation Checklist

| Priority | Task | Target Team | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| P1 | Schema Markup Integration | Development | Standardize and implement relevant Schema (e.g., FAQPage, HowTo, Product, Article, HealthcareBusiness) on all primary content templates to explicitly define data for AI extraction. Focus on FAQ sections, service descriptions, and pricing information. |
| P2 | Structured Data for Healthcare Services | Development | Implement MedicalBusiness, MedicalService, and InsuranceAgency schema markup across service pages to help AI understand our healthcare offerings, coverage areas, and pricing structure. |
| P3 | Enhanced Meta Descriptions as AI Summaries | Development | Restructure meta descriptions to serve as concise AI-friendly summaries (150-160 chars) that directly answer common healthcare questions about our services, eligibility, and costs. |

## 2. Content Strategy Implementation Checklist

| Priority | Task | Target Team | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| P1 | Implement "Direct Answer" Blocks | Content | For every new high-intent article, include a concise, 2-3 sentence summary in the first paragraph, formatted to answer the main user query directly. Example: "MPB Health Essentials costs $49.95/month and includes unlimited virtual urgent care, primary care, mental health services, and concierge support with no additional visit fees." |
| P2 | Question-Based Content Structure | Content | Structure all content around specific healthcare questions users ask AI (e.g., "What does virtual urgent care include?", "How much does telemedicine cost?"). Use these exact questions as H2/H3 headings. |
| P3 | Authoritative Source Citations | Content | Include specific credentials, certifications, and data sources in content (e.g., "According to our HIPAA-certified healthcare advisors..." or "Based on 10,000+ member experiences...") to establish E-E-A-T authority for AI platforms. |
| P4 | Step-by-Step Process Documentation | Content | Create detailed, numbered process guides for common healthcare scenarios (enrollment, using virtual care, filing claims) using clear action verbs and specific timeframes that AI can easily parse and summarize. |
| P5 | Comparison and Definition Sections | Content | Add explicit comparison tables and definition blocks for healthcare terms, competitor alternatives, and service differentiators using consistent formatting that AI can extract for comparison queries. |

## 3. Existing Content Audit & Remediation

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Identify Top-of-Funnel (ToFu) Pages | Use Analytics/GSC to find 20 pages that rank highly for conversational queries (e.g., "what is virtual urgent care," "how much does telemedicine cost," "best healthcare membership plans"). Focus on healthcare-specific informational queries. |
| 2 | Add Structured Q&A Sections | Retrofit existing high-performing pages with FAQ sections using actual questions from customer support, sales calls, and search queries. Format with structured data markup for maximum AI extraction potential. |
| 3 | Create Topic Cluster Hub Pages | Develop comprehensive hub pages for core topics (Virtual Healthcare, Healthcare Memberships, Telemedicine Costs) that synthesize information across multiple existing pages into single, authoritative sources AI platforms prefer to reference. |

## 4. GEO Success Metrics (KPIs)

**KPI 1: AI Platform Citation Rate** (Why: Focuses on measuring how often our content appears as direct citations or sources in AI-generated responses across Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and other platforms)

**KPI 2: Featured Snippet Retention & Expansion** (Why: Focuses on maintaining and growing featured snippets as they serve as training data for AI models and indicate content structured for direct answers)

**KPI 3: Question-Intent Ranking Velocity** (Why: Focuses on how quickly our content ranks for conversational, question-based queries that mirror how users interact with AI platforms, indicating content optimization for generative search behaviors)
